## Working with Spatio-temporal Climate data with Xarray

In this tutorial we  will be looking at sea surface temaperatures using Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2) data.  This tutorial borrows heavily from [this tutorial](https://comptools.climatematch.io/tutorials/W1D1_ClimateSystemOverview/student/W1D1_Tutorial5.html) by Computational Tools in Climate Science.  That tutorial has much more information about climatology, the focus here is using Xarray for data cubes.  

First import libraries and download dataset.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
from pythia_datasets import DATASETS
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


filepath = DATASETS.fetch('CESM2_sst_data.nc')
```

Open the dataset and inspect.  It is an Xarray Dataset.  It has coordinates lat, lon, and time.  It has spatial and time coordinates, hence we call it a spatio-temporal dataset.

```{python}
ds = xr.open_dataset(filepath)
ds
```
