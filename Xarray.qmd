## Working with Spatio-temporal Climate data with Xarray

In this tutorial we  will be looking at sea surface temaperatures using Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2) data.  This tutorial borrows heavily from [this tutorial](https://comptools.climatematch.io/tutorials/W1D1_ClimateSystemOverview/student/W1D1_Tutorial5.html) by Computational Tools in Climate Science.  That tutorial has much more information about climatology, the focus here is using Xarray for data cubes.  

First import libraries and download dataset.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
from pythia_datasets import DATASETS
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


filepath = DATASETS.fetch('CESM2_sst_data.nc')
```

Open the dataset and inspect.  It is an Xarray Dataset.  It has coordinates lat, lon, and time.  It has corresponding indices  It has spatial and time coordinates, hence we call it a spatio-temporal dataset.

```{python}
ds = xr.open_dataset(filepath)
ds
```
