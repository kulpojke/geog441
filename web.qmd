# Ways to show maps

## Load Data
```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
from pathlib import Path

# If you are following along change path 
change_this = Path('/home/michael/CP/UEFI/vectors')
buildings_path = change_this / 'eaton_buildings.geojson'
aoi_path = change_this / 'Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson'

# read buildings and aoi
buildings = gpd.read_file(buildings_path)
aoi = gpd.read_file(aoi_path)
```

## Simple

```{python}

import contextily as cx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

buildings.plot(color='red', figsize=(9, 9))
```
Not overwhelming.  Some buildings, but it would be nice to have a base map.

```{python}
ax = buildings.plot(color='red', figsize=(9, 9))
cx.add_basemap(ax, crs=buildings.crs)

plt.show()
```
