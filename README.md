# Syllabus
Welcome to GEOG 441, Advanced Geospatial Methods

## Course Objectives
This course is designed to allow students with varying degrees of GIS and remote sensing experience to increase their knowledge.  The class is mainly focussed on Python, R and other open source geospatial tools.  Students are free to choose the exercises that are most relevant to their goals.

That said there are a few skills and tools that students need to grasp by the end of the class.
+ Basic use of GIT for project management
+ Ability to use either Python or R to perform geospatial tasks

### Exercises
In order to accommodate students with different levels of knowledge, and different goals, exercises are offered 

+ [Github tutorial](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) (x pts)
